# Airplane-seat-reservation-system-using-CSharp-and-Windows-form 
In this project, we will make an airplane reservation system. In this system
* A User can sign up or log in on this app.
* The user can reserve a seat by paying a bill.
* The user can check the total reserved and empty seats.
* The user can see all airplanes present in the station of a specific city.
* The user can search for different city stations (arrival) and can book the seat of a specific city (departure) airplane, he wants.
* The user can see the amount of bills and other information about specific airplanes like departure time, arrival time, etc.
* The user can cancel the booking before 2 hours of departure time. In this case, he should pay a fine of 25% of the total bill amount and 75% of its amount returned to it.
* The user can buy premium services in Journey if he wants. In this case, a music player, premium food, gaming setup, sleeping setup, etc... will provided to him, which will charge 50% extra to the ticket.
* The user will have an encrypted barcode (printed on the ticket, which he gets at booking time) which will be used to identify him. This will save time, which is consumed by checking every person and detect automatically the person who buys the ticket and enters that person.

In this project, I add many extra features like
1) Login through barcode
2) Email verification
3) Admin panel with many options
4) Controlled access to the admin panel, blocking admin/customer functionality
5) Use client-server architecture
6) And many more...
